## Key Features

### 1. **CarNFT: Tokenized Vehicle Ownership**
- Vehicles are represented as NFTs (Non-Fungible Tokens) on the blockchain.
- Each NFT includes detailed metadata such as make, model, year, VIN, and registration number.
- Maintenance records, issue reports, and vehicle history are securely stored and immutable.
- Ownership transfers are simplified and verifiable, enhancing resale value.

### 2. **Maintenance and Issue Tracking**
- Comprehensive maintenance history with service provider details and mileage.
- Issue reporting with evidence (e.g., images, videos) stored on IPFS.
- AI-powered diagnostics for issue analysis and resolution recommendations.

### 3. **Digital Mechanic Integration**
- AI-driven tools to analyze maintenance records and issue reports.
- Provides actionable insights for vehicle diagnostics and repair planning.
